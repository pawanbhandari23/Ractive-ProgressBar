# Ractive-ProgressBar
---------------------

What is it?
------------
It is a progressbar controlled through the buttons using Ractive.js. There are three bars that are in selection. Each bar progress is 
controlled through each button i.e. increase or decrease by + or -, 10 or 25. The decrement doesnot go below 0 but goes above 100. The 
specific color codes are used accordingly. The CSS preprocessor SCSS is used for CSS. And, the code uses the minified version of 
javascript and CSS to make it fast and production ready. The javascript minification code is done via gulp. Thegulp.js file is written 
for minification.
